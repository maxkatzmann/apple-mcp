# Apple MCP Servers

A collection of [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers that provide AI assistants with access to native Apple applications on macOS.

## Servers

| Server | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [Apple Notes](#apple-notes) | Done | Read, create, update, move, and delete notes and folders |
| [Apple Messages](#apple-messages) | Done | Read message history, search conversations, and send messages |
| [Apple Contacts](#apple-contacts) | Done | Manage contacts, groups, and contact details |
| [Apple Mail](#apple-mail) | Done | Read, send, search, flag, and manage email |
| [Apple Reminders](#apple-reminders) | Done | Create, update, complete, and manage reminders and lists |
| [Apple Calendar](#apple-calendar) | Done | Create, update, and manage calendar events |
| [Apple Maps](#apple-maps) | Done | Search locations, get directions, and drop pins (visual only — limited by Apple's automation support) |

## Requirements

- **macOS** (uses AppleScript and macOS-specific APIs)
- **Node.js** 18+ (22+ for Apple Messages)
- **Full Disk Access** granted to your terminal app (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access) — required for reading the Messages database
- **The associated Apple app must be running** — each MCP server communicates with its corresponding app via AppleScript, so the app (e.g. Contacts, Mail, Notes) needs to be open for the server to function

## Safety Modes

All servers (except Apple Maps, which is UI-only) support two optional safety flags:

| Mode | Flag | Behaviour |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Normal** (default) | _(none)_ | All tools available, no restrictions |
| **Read-only** | `--read-only` | Destructive/write tools are not registered at all |
| **Confirm** | `--confirm-destructive` | Destructive tools require a `confirm: true` parameter; without it they return a warning asking the AI to check with the user first |

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-notes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@griches/apple-notes-mcp"]
    },
    "apple-messages": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@griches/apple-messages-mcp"]
    },
    "apple-contacts": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@griches/apple-contacts-mcp"]
    },
    "apple-reminders": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@griches/apple-reminders-mcp"]
    },
    "apple-calendar": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@griches/apple-calendar-mcp"]
    },
    "apple-maps": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@griches/apple-maps-mcp"]
    },
    "apple-mail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@griches/apple-mail-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Install from Source

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/griches/apple-mcp.git
cd apple-mcp

# Apple Notes
cd notes && npm install && npm run build

# Apple Messages
cd ../messages && npm install && npm run build

# Apple Contacts
cd ../contacts && npm install && npm run build

# Apple Reminders
cd ../reminders && npm install && npm run build

# Apple Calendar
cd ../calendar && npm install && npm run build

# Apple Maps
cd ../maps && npm install && npm run build

# Apple Mail
cd ../mail && npm install && npm run build
```

Then configure your MCP client to run the built files directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-notes": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/notes/build/index.js"]
    },
    "apple-messages": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/messages/build/index.js"]
    },
    "apple-contacts": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/contacts/build/index.js"]
    },
    "apple-reminders": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/reminders/build/index.js"]
    },
    "apple-calendar": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/calendar/build/index.js"]
    },
    "apple-maps": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/maps/build/index.js"]
    },
    "apple-mail": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mail/build/index.js"]

---

## Apple Maps

An MCP server that interacts with Apple Maps using Maps URL schemes.

> **Note:** Apple Maps has a very limited AppleScript/automation dictionary compared to other Apple apps. There is no supported way to programmatically read back search results, route details, or location data from Maps. As a result, these tools open Apple Maps with the requested query but cannot return structured data (e.g. addresses, coordinates, distances) to the agent. The results are visual — you'll see them in the Maps app.

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_location` | Search for a location in Apple Maps |
| `get_directions` | Get directions between two locations (driving, walking, or transit) |
| `drop_pin` | Drop a pin at specific coordinates |
| `open_address` | Open a specific address in Apple Maps |
| `save_to_favorites` | Open a location in Maps so you can save it as a favorite |

### Usage Examples

- "Search for coffee shops near Times Square"
- "Get walking directions from Central Park to the Met"
- "Show me 1 Apple Park Way, Cupertino on a map"
- "Drop a pin at 48.8584, 2.2945"

| `mark_read` | Mark an email as read or unread |
| `delete_message` | Delete an email (moves to trash) |
| `flag_message` | Flag or unflag an email message |
