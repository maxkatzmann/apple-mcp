## Servers

## Requirements

- **macOS** (uses AppleScript and macOS-specific APIs)
- **Node.js** 18+ for Apple Notes, 22+ for Apple Messages
- **Full Disk Access** granted to your terminal app (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access) — required for reading the Messages database

## Quick Start

No cloning or building required — install and run directly with `npx`:

```bash
# Apple Notes
npx @griches/apple-notes-mcp

# Apple Messages
npx @griches/apple-messages-mcp
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add apple-notes -- npx @griches/apple-notes-mcp
claude mcp add apple-messages -- npx @griches/apple-messages-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-notes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@griches/apple-notes-mcp"]
    },
    "apple-messages": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@griches/apple-messages-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Install from Source

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/griches/apple-mcp.git
cd apple-mcp

# Apple Notes
cd notes && npm install && npm run build

# Apple Messages
cd ../messages && npm install && npm run build
```

Then configure your MCP client to run the built files directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-notes": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/notes/build/index.js"]
    },
    "apple-messages": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/messages/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```
